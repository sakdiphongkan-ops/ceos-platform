# LUNA real latency ledger v1

The TH1H worker records a `LATENCY_METRIC` audit event after each non-HOLD execution completes.

Recorded fields include:

- `quote_ts`
- `market_lag_ms`
- `analysis_ms`
- `queue_wait_ms`
- `execution_ms`
- `end_to_end_ms`
- `market_phase`
- `source`

The production `luna-api` Edge Function v33 exposes:

- default feed: `latency.summary`
- dedicated view: `?view=latency`
- percentile metrics: p50 / p95 / p99 / max
- sample count

Important interpretation rule:

`sample_count = 0` means that no execution has produced a `LATENCY_METRIC` event yet. It must not be displayed as a measured zero-latency result.

The synthetic latency/backpressure harness remains separate from this real execution ledger. The harness validates processing capacity; the production ledger measures observed runtime latency.
